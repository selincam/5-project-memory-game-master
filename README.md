## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play?

After you click the boxes you see on the screen, a symbol will appear. After that click another box. Here you see another symbol. If the symbols match, the symbols will remain on. Otherwise it will close. To win the game, all cards have to be matched in this way.

Ps: If you complete the game with less move, you will earn more stars.
